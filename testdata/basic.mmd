Main header
===========

Decorating text
---------------

Text can be _italic_ or **bold**.

You can include any international characters you like, as long as
everything is encoded in UTF-8: Æ Ø Å, æ ø å, Göteborg, naïveté.

Lists
-----

* Item A
* Item B
* Item C

1. Ordered item A
2. Ordered item B
    * Nested Item B.A
    * Nested Item B.B

### Deep subheader

You can always write the subheaders with only # characters prefixed.

Code blocks
-----------

```python
def factorial(n):
    import operator
    return reduce(operator.mul, xrange(2,n+1), 1)
```

That was some Python code.
